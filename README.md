# Riphah CGPA and GPA Calculator

This is a console based cgpa and gpa calulator accordfing Riphah University's Grading System I do am to convert it into a Web App So You Guys can check GPA and CGPA Online. 

# How to use this?

Download the `cgpa_calculator.py` and run the python file. Enter the number of semester you want CGPA for or if you only want GPA of 1 semester enter Number of Semesters to be 1 when asked to enter semester. 

Let's say you have 5 subjects in a semester, you will have to first input credit hours of each subject separated by comma and then later add marks respectively. 

For Example:

# What to expect?

I will be converting this into a web app so everyone can check their CGPA or GPA online without needing to run a console application.

In the upcoming commits to this repository, Iâ€™ll be updating the code to calculate CGPA and GPA directly from CSV files. This means users can upload a CSV containing total credit hours and subject-wise marks to perform the calculations. This feature is intended to assist the Exam Department at Riphah University as part of this mini-project.
